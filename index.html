    <h1> Project on console</h1>
    <p> Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor, which has been made by Microsoft and is available for Windows,Linux and macOS.</p>
    <p> The console application is a program in Visual Studio, which accepts the input parameter, calls what service is required and sends the output to the console.
        When on the live server, to open the consle screen, you need to do a right click and you need to click on the option inspect.
        To make sure something goes onto the console, use this code: console.log(). </p>
<script>
    var first_name="Ranbir";
    console.log(first_name);

    var last_name="Kapoor";
    console.log(last_name);

    var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
    console.log(full_name);

    var a= 8;
    var b= 16;

    var add= a + b;
    console.log(add);

    var subtract= b-a;
    console.log(subtract); 
    
    var square_root=Math.sqrt(16);
    console.log(square_root);

    var power=Math.pow(8, 3);
    console.log(power);
